**📡 Arduino Morse Code Generator & Transmitter**

An interactive and hardware-integrated Morse Code Generator built using Arduino that converts alphanumeric text (A–Z, 0–9) into standard Morse code signals 🔤➡️📶.

This system allows users to enter a custom message through the Serial Monitor, which is then translated into dots and dashes following official Morse timing rules ⏱️. The encoded output is transmitted using an LED 💡 for visual indication and a buzzer 🔊 for audio feedback, creating a real-time signaling system.

A push-button trigger 🔘 is integrated to control when the transmission begins, making the project fully interactive and hardware-driven rather than purely software-based.

The project demonstrates key embedded systems concepts including:

⚙️ Digital Input/Output interfacing

🧠 String processing and character mapping

⏱️ Precise timing control using delays

🔌 Hardware integration with external components

💻 Real-time signal generation

This project serves as a strong foundation for understanding communication systems, signal encoding techniques, and microcontroller-based embedded programming. It can be further expanded into wireless transmission, LCD display integration, or even a Morse code decoder system 🚀.
